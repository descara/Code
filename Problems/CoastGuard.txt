Problem Statement
    	If you look on a map of Foxland, you will notice that there is a sea to the north of Foxland. For the purpose of this problem, the coast is the straight line y = 0. The halfplane with y > 0 is the sea, and the opposite halfplane is Foxland. 



Fox Ciel is the commander of the Foxland Coast Guard (FCG). One day, a fleet of n enemy warships approached Foxland. Luckily, the FCG has exactly n cannons placed along the coast, so Ciel can attack each warship using a different cannon. 



You are given the coordinates of cannons and warships in the int[]s d, x, and y. Cannon i is located at the point (d[i], 0). Warship j is located at the point (x[j], y[j]). 



There are n! possible ways how to assign the cannons to the warships. A cannon trajectory is the line segment that connects the cannon and the warship. An assignment of cannons to warships is good if all cannon trajectories are disjoint - in other words, if no two trajectories intersect each other. 



Count all good assignments of cannons to warships, and return that count modulo 10^9 + 7.

Examples
0)	
    	
{-2, 2}
{0, 1}
{1, 2}
Returns: 2
There are two cannons and two warships. Both assignments of cannons to warships are good, so we should return 2.
1)	
    	
{1,2}
{1,2}
{10,10}
Returns: 1
This time, the situation looks as follows:
Cannon 0 is located at (1,0).
Cannon 1 is located at (2,0).
Warship 0 is located at (1,10).
Warship 1 is located at (2,10).
The only good assignment is (cannon 0 shoots warship 0, cannon 1 shoots warship 1). The other assignment is not good: the two cannon trajectories intersect.
2)	
    	
{-2, 2, 98, 102}
{0, 1, 100, 101}
{1, 2, 1, 2}
Returns: 4

{1,109,229,294,589,615,741,822,859,1000}
{546,850,287,452,864,874,529,879,818,589}
{414,176,191,15,764,825,204,477,34,460}
Returns: 400

{-1,0,1}
{0,0,0}
{1,2,3}
Returns: 2
Note that two line segments do also intersect if the endpoint of one segment lies on another segment.
