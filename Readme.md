# Upskill project
---

The plan is to absorb two large bodies of knowledge by the end of the year, these can be broadly divided into:
* Exploit Development
* Data Science

Data science will take longer and a lot more effort as it includes several knew skillsets that have to be
learned. This repo is intended to act as repo for storing notes and tutorial links that I find in the process of
learning

## Data Science/Artificial Intelligence
Data science is a very large topic and the point is to learn at least the foundations of the topic to be able
to apply it for small scale analysis

### Courses
Courses from various online MOOC websites that can help in understanding the various concepts invovled in 
* [Udemy course A-Z Data Science]()

### Mathematics Required
Different topics in mathematics have to be understood to better work on Data Science topics
* Linear Algebra
	* [Khan Acadmey Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
* Calculus
	* [Khan Academy Differential Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus)
